# Whereâ€™s Waldo?

This is a ["Where's Waldo?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F) web app built using a Ruby on Rails back end and a JavaScript front end.

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app?ref=lnav).

## Getting Started

Where's Waldo is built in Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.0.2.

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, seed the database:
```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
